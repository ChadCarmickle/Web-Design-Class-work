        <p class="Sum"> The third girl, brook was a loud character, having grown up in Hawaii she was always afraid of sharks and never dared to swim in the waters fearing them, she never had to worry about eating as her family were wealthy so instead she spent a lot of her time in the kitchen cooking various meals and talking with the chief learning what she could do and help out. She often surprised her parents with meals she had cooked and  enjoyed their reaction every time, apart from cooking Brook also loved singing and doing arts and crafts in her down time.
